Hi Tim,

I hope this finds you well, I really have recently learned a lot after =
discovering awk.info!

--
I'm sorry to bother you with a licensing question, but here goes:

I am blown away by a parser I found on the site,
http://awk.info/?doc/tools/xmlparse.html

I'm writing some utilities which collectively fall under a BSD license, =
and would very much like to use the base of that parser.  I see (and =
respect) that the site/repo content appears to be covered under a GPLv3 =
license, (totally incompatible with my work, under the BSD license).

Is there any way that the xmlparse.awk code be formally released under a =
BSD, or even LGPL license?  Or, that you grant me permission to =
re-release the code under a BSD license?
My only alternative would be to re-write similar parser code from =
scratch, (daunting), and I'd really rather instead give proper =
attribution to awk.info, and the original author, Steve Coile.

I believe in the spirit of the original work of Aho, Weinberger, and =
Kernighan at AT&T, that this hopefully not taken an unreasonable or =
insulting request.  My intention with the BSD license is to require =
attribution, and keep the source open and freely available in with no =
restrictions for use.

Thanks for your consideration.  And more importantly, thanks for running =
awk.info, I've learned a lot from it, and I really appreciate your =
tastes and approaches in shell, POSIX, and UNIX!
