Hi Steve,

I hope this finds you well, I really found your 10 year old =
xmlparse.awk, on awk.info.  Learned a *ton* reading it end to end.

--
I'm sorry to bother you with a licensing question, but here goes:

I am blown away by a parser I found on the site,
http://awk.info/?doc/tools/xmlparse.html

I'm writing some utilities which collectively fall under a BSD license, =
and would very much like to use the base of that parser.

I see (and respect) that the awk.info site/repo content appears to be =
covered under a GPLv3 license, (totally incompatible with my work, under =
the BSD license).  I also found that your 2001 work, does not appear to =
be releaseed under any license,
ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff/xmlparser.awk

Is there any way that I can include the xmlparse.awk code be formally =
used in my code under a BSD license?  Or, that you grant me permission =
to re-release the code under a BSD license?
My only alternative would be to re-write similar parser code from =
scratch, (daunting), and I'd really rather instead give proper =
attribution to your work, (and nod to the places I've found it).

I believe in the spirit of the original work of Aho, Weinberger, and =
Kernighan at AT&T, that this hopefully not taken an unreasonable or =
insulting request.  My intention with the BSD license is to require =
attribution, and keep the source open and freely available in with no =
restrictions for use.

Thanks for your consideration.  And more importantly, thanks for writing =
that sucker=85

Rocket-

(what follows is an email I sent to the person who apparently runs the =
awk.info website, where I originally found your xmlparse.awk in their =
repo)
