Hi Tim,<br>
<br>
I hope this finds you well, I really have recently learned a lot after disc=
overing <a href=3D"http://awk.info" target=3D"_blank">awk.info</a>!<br>
<br>

I&#39;m sorry to bother you with a licensing question, but here goes:<br>
<br>
I am blown away by a parser I found on the site,<br>
<a href=3D"http://awk.info/?doc/tools/xmlparse.html" target=3D"_blank">http=
://awk.info/?doc/tools/xmlparse.html</a><br>
<br>
I&#39;m writing some utilities which collectively fall under a BSD license,=
 and would very much like to use the base of that parser. =C2=A0I see (and =
respect) that the site/repo content appears to be covered under a GPLv3 lic=
ense, (totally incompatible with my work, under the BSD license).<br>

<br>
Is there any way that the xmlparse.awk code be formally released under a BS=
D, or even LGPL license? =C2=A0Or, that you grant me permission to re-relea=
se the code under a BSD license?<br>
My only alternative would be to re-write similar parser code from scratch, =
(daunting), and I&#39;d really rather instead give proper attribution to <a=
 href=3D"http://awk.info" target=3D"_blank">awk.info</a>, and the original =
author, Steve Coile.<br>

<br>
I believe in the spirit of the original work of Aho, Weinberger, and Kernig=
han at AT&amp;T, that this hopefully not taken an unreasonable or insulting=
 request. =C2=A0My intention with the BSD license is to require attribution=
, and keep the source open and freely available in with no restrictions for=

<br>
Thanks for your consideration. =C2=A0And more importantly, thanks for runni=
